This code defines a function run_simulation that creates a power grid using the pandapower package and connects various elements such as external grid connections, transformers, loads, and photovoltaic (PV) plants.

The grid has two external grid connections at buses b1 and b4, two transformers that connect the medium-voltage side to the low-voltage side, two loads at buses b3 and b6, and five PV plants at bus b5. The transformers, loads, and PV plants are connected to the grid via lines. The line connecting b2 and b3 connects the first transformer to the first load, the line connecting b4 and b5 connects the second transformer to the PV plants, and the line connecting b4 and b6 connects the second transformer to the second load.

When the run_simulation function is called, it creates the power grid and returns the net object that contains all of the information about the grid.


Furthermore, this code creates a Flask web server that exposes a single endpoint, /grid-power-analysis/, that returns the active and reactive power values for the loads, PV plants, and external grid connections in a power grid.

When a client sends a GET request to the /grid-power-analysis/ endpoint, the grid_power_analysis function is called. This function first calls the run_simulation function from the test_sim module to create the power grid and store it in the net object. It then initializes an empty dictionary called results to store the active and reactive power values of the loads, PV plants, and external grid connections.
